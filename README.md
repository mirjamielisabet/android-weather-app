# Weather App

Mobile Application that shows the current weather and the forecast for the user's chosen location.

The user can check the weather and forecast for the current location by using the device's location sensors or by entering the location in the input field.
The current weather section shows the basic information about the weather: temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description and weather icon. The forecast is for the next seven days, and shows a bit shorter info about the weather: date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed and weather description.  

This App is created as a part of the Native Mobile Development course in TAMK (Tampere University of Applied Sciences).
